# Wordle Clone

A simple and interactive Wordle game clone built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Challenge yourself to guess a five-letter word in six attempts.

- **Color-coded feedback**: 
  - **Green** for correct letters in the right position.
  - **Yellow** for correct letters in the wrong position.
